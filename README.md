# Private Access

## Purpose

In a world where personal information is sought after every second of everyday in the year, we need to know that what is pertient to the security of  our sensitive informations is handled similar to that of a classified government document.

 Some password that are made are quite easy to figure out due to wanting to later recolate the password or under pressure by time forming one, this application solves that problem. The password apllication will randomly generate a password which save the user the time of doing it themselves.

The option to use letters in the alphabet (with capitol and lowercase letters specification), numbers and special characters ([ refer to the list of password special characters here ](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters) from the OWASP Foundation) are available to tailor the password to the users needs.

## User Story
